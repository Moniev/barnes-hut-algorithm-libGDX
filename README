Barnes-Hut Simulation
This project simulates gravitational interactions of particles in a two-dimensional space using the Barnes-Hut algorithm, an efficient approximation method for N-body simulations. Instead of computing gravitational forces between all particle pairs, which has an O(N²) complexity, the Barnes-Hut algorithm groups distant particles into clusters and approximates their collective gravitational effect. This is achieved using a quadtree, which hierarchically divides the 2D simulation space into square regions, enabling fast force calculations. The algorithm is ideal for simulating large-scale systems, such as planetary systems or galaxy dynamics, in two dimensions.
Examples
The quadtree structure significantly reduces the computational cost of force calculations, making it possible to simulate thousands of particles efficiently. By organizing particles into a hierarchical grid, the system minimizes the number of distance calculations required, achieving a complexity of O(N log N).
Features

Quadtree-based spatial partitioning: Reduces computational complexity from O(N²) to O(N log N) for force calculations.
Barnes-Hut approximation: Efficiently handles gravitational interactions by clustering distant particles.
Scalable for large systems: Capable of simulating over 8,000 particles smoothly in 2D.

Installation

Install libGDX to build the Maven project.
Clone the libgdx-maven-archetype repository:
git clone git://github.com/libgdx/libgdx-maven-archetype.git
cd libgdx-maven-archetype
mvn install


Clone project repository:
git clone https://github.com/Moniev/barnes-hut-libGDX
cd barnes-hut-libGDX


Run the Maven clean and install command: (Also starts program after successful installation)
mvn clean install -Pdesktop


After the above steps, you should be able to run the program with:
mvn integration-test -Pdesktop
